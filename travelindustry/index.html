        <h1>- The Impact of the Pandemic on the Travel Industry -</h1>
        <p>
          We have all witnessed for the past few years, how the unexpected can
          affect our lives and everything around us. The pandemic because of
          COVID-19 is something that is still very present in each of us because
          of the worldwide impact that it had and a big part of the world
          population had not been through anything similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of how unexpected this was; both individuals and companies
          struggled at managing the scenario that it presented. The travel
          industry was not an exception to it, considering that it was heavily
          affected by the outcome of this pandemic. Travel stopped at all levels
          and it was very difficult to forecast how the recovery would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site will help people to have an overview of how the COVID-19
          affected the travel industry, not only during the pandemic but how the
          industry has changed because of this.
