        <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the airline
            industry and travel agencies. There was a travel demand decline;
            travel restrictions and safety concerns caused a significant decrease
            in travel demand, resulting in reduced bookings and revenue for
            airlines and travel agencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the financial side, there was a decline in revenue that has created
            financial struggles for these industries, with fixed costs and reduced
            income affecting their operations and viability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Travel restrictions and changing regulations have created uncertainty,
            leading to the adoption of enhanced health and safety measures.
            Airlines and travel agencies have also embraced digital solutions and
            flexibility to accommodate customer needs.

            The long-term consequences of the pandemic on these industries are
            still unfolding, and recovery is expected to be gradual. Factors such
            as vaccination efforts, government policies, and travel confidence
            will shape the industry's future.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, COVID-19 has presented unprecedented challenges for
            airlines and travel agencies, requiring adaptation and resilience.
            Understanding the lasting effects is crucial for navigating the path
            to recovery and shaping the future of these industries.
